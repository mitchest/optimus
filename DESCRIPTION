Description: Assessment and diagnostics for comparing competing
    clustering solutions, using predictive models. The main intended
    use is for comparing clustering/classification solutions of
    ecological data (e.g. presence/absence, counts, ordinal scores) to
    1) find an optimal partitioning solution, 2) identify
    characteristic species and 3) refine a classification by merging
    clusters that increase predictive performance. However, in a more
    general sense, this package can do the above for any set of
    clustering solutions for i observations of j variables.
