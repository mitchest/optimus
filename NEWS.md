# optimus 0.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* This is the first release on CRAN - the package is now at the point where I am not making changes very frequently
* This version now has a vignette, so that should be your first port of call
* There has been no major functionality change since Sept 2016, just bug fixes and optimisations
* Check for changes in between CRAN releases: https://github.com/mitchest/optimus
